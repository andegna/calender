in a composer.json file and, with a few simple commands, Composer will automatically
download your project’s dependencies and setup autoloading for you.

You can install composer by running
```sh
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

```sh
    composer require andegna/calender
